This is a calorie tracker application made in flutter.

# How to run this application? 

In order to run it on web, first clone then you will need flutter firebase api keys. Create a .env file in the same repository as the application. Go to https://firebase.google.com and create a new web app. 
There you will find api key information.
Enter it like this :-

apiKey = "Your_key"
authDomain = "Your_key"
projectId = "Your_key"
storageBucket = "Your_key"
messagingSenderId = "Your_key"
appId = "Your_key"

If you want to run it in any mobile device, like iOS or android, you will need the google plist file. You can do the same process of going to https://firebase.google.com and creating an iOS or android app there, then just copy the plist file to iOS or android folder depending on which one you prefer. 

That's it!
